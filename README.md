# Autonomous-RC-car
A project for the 2022 fall term of Engineering design and development at West park high school where we installed a Matek 743 Wing onto a rc car and gave it self driving capabilitys. 
Credit to Colin Malone, Ty Snyder and a big thanks to Mr.Waltz with helping get parts and letting us use one of his old Rc cars. 
These files will provide all the information needed to mount new parts and use the car. It will also have info about how to use Ardupilots mission planner and how to fix paramiters in case they are messed up.
